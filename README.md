# **Introduction**

Greetings, fellow gamers and data enthusiasts! In this project we are going see the evolution of video games from 1980-2023. Video games, once a niche hobby, have transformed into a global phenomenon, captivating audiences of all ages and backgrounds. 

Since the release of the first commercial video game, "Computer Space," in 1971, the industry has continued to evolve and expand, with new technologies and platforms constantly being introduced.The rise of online gaming has allowed gamers to connect and play with others from all over the world, creating a global community that is constantly evolving and growing.

Our goal is to explore and analyze the dataset, focusing on identifying the most popular game genres, determining the teams that produce the highest number of popular games, and observing how the distribution of these genres and teams has evolved over time.
