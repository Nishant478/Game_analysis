In this project we are going see the evolution of video games from 1980-2023. Video games, once a niche hobby, have transformed into a global phenomenon, captivating audiences of all ages and backgrounds. \n\nSince the release of the first commercial video game, \"Computer Space,\" in 1971, the industry has continued to evolve and expand, with new technologies and platforms constantly being introduced.The rise of online gaming has allowed gamers to connect and play with others from all over the world, creating a global community that is constantly evolving and growing.\n\nOur goal is to explore and analyze the dataset, focusing on identifying the most popular game genres, determining the teams that produce the highest number of popular games, and observing how the distribution of these genres and teams has evolved over time.

In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.\n  Reviews                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n1 [\"\"The first playthrough of elden ring is one of the best eperiences gaming can offer you but after youve explored everything in the open world and you've experienced all of the surprises you lose motivation to go exploring on repeat playthroughs which takes a lot away from the replayability which is a very important thing for from games imo.\"\", 'a replay solidified my love for elden ring. so easily my favorite game of all time. actually beating malenia this time was also an amazing feeling. i just love being in this world man its the greatest of all time', 'The game is absolutely beautiful, with so much to do.
